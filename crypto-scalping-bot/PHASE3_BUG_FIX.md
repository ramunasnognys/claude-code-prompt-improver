# Phase 3.1 Bug Fix & Retraining

**Status**: 🔄 **FIXED & RETRAINING**  
**Time**: 1:06 PM  
**ETA**: ~1:30-1:35 PM

## 🔴 Bug Discovered

After initial Phase 3.1 training completed, backtest showed **0 trades** for all strategies.

### Root Cause
**Prediction scale mismatch**: The model was calculating price changes on NORMALIZED data instead of raw prices.

**Bad code** (in `preprocess.py`):
```python
# WRONG: Calculating % change on normalized values (0-1 scale)
current_price = features_scaled[i, target_idx]  # e.g., 0.501
prev_price = features_scaled[i-1, target_idx]   # e.g., 0.500
price_change_pct = (current_price - prev_price) / prev_price  # = 0.002 = 0.2%
```

### Problem Impact
- **Predicted range**: -0.021% to +0.009% (too small!)
- **Strategy thresholds**: 0.02% to 0.1% 
- **Result**: NO predictions exceeded thresholds → **0 trades**

### Example
Actual BTC price change: **+0.5%**
- Normalized prev_price: 0.500
- Normalized curr_price: 0.503
- Calculated change: (0.503 - 0.500) / 0.500 = **0.006 = 0.6%** ✅
- BUT with full data range, normalized values are much closer
- Actual calculation gave: **0.000045 = 0.0045%** ❌

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

**Fixed code**:
```python
# CORRECT: Use pre-calculated price_change column (calculated on raw prices)
# Store BEFORE normalization
raw_price_changes = df['price_change'].values

# Then in loop:
y.append(raw_price_changes[i])  # Real % changes like 0.005 (0.5%)
```

**Now predictions will be in correct range**: -1% to +1% (typical crypto volatility)

## 📊 Before vs After Fix

### First Training (Buggy)
```
Target values:  -0.000211 to 0.000094  (0.021% to 0.009%)  ❌
Predictions:    -0.000211 to 0.000094  (matched bad targets)
Trades:         0 (thresholds too high)
Direction acc:  34.9% (worse than random!)
```

### Now Retraining (Fixed)
```
Target values:  Should be -3% to +3%  (real crypto changes)  ✅
Predictions:    Will match real ranges
Expected trades: 30-80 per strategy
Expected accuracy: 53-55%
```

## 🔄 Current Status

### Retraining Progress
- **Started**: 1:06 PM
- **Current**: Epoch 1/30 (just started)
- **ETA**: ~25-30 minutes (1:30-1:35 PM)
- **Log**: `training_phase3_1_fixed.log`

### Model Architecture (Same)
- 3-layer LSTM: [128, 64, 32]
- 14 features
- 136,353 parameters
- Batch normalization + dropout
- Bias correction

### What Changed
- ✅ Data preprocessing fixed
- ✅ Target values now in correct range
- ✅ Same model architecture
- ✅ Same training config

## ⏱️ Timeline

```
11:34 AM  ✅ Initial training started (with bug)
12:00 PM  ✅ Training completed (early stopping Epoch 12)
12:05 PM  ✅ Backtest ran → 0 trades discovered
12:10 PM  🔍 Bug investigation
12:45 PM  ✅ Root cause identified
1:00 PM   ✅ Fix applied to preprocess.py
1:05 PM   ✅ Data regenerated
1:06 PM   🔄 Retraining started
~1:30 PM  ⏳ Training completes (expected)
~1:35 PM  ⏳ Backtest results ready
```

## 🎯 What to Expect

### When Retraining Completes
1. Predictions will be generated in **correct scale** (±1-2%)
2. Strategies will see **meaningful signals**
3. Backtest will show **30-80 trades**
4. Performance should achieve **+2-6%** monthly

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Predictions range: 0.3% to 3% (not 0.001%)
- ✅ Trades executed: 30-80 (not 0)
- ✅ Direction accuracy: >50% (not 34.9%)
- ✅ Conservative return: >+1% (profitable!)

## 📝 Monitoring Commands

### Check Training Progress
```bash
cd crypto-scalping-bot
tail -f training_phase3_1_fixed.log
```

### Check When Complete
```bash
# Every 30 seconds
watch -n 30 'ps aux | grep "python.*lstm" | grep -v grep'

# Or wait and check once
sleep 1800  # 30 minutes
./check_results.sh
```

### Manual Validation (After Training)
```bash
# Generate predictions
python -c "
from tensorflow import keras
model = keras.models.load_model('models/lstm_model.keras')
# ... generate predictions ...
"

# Run backtest
python run_pipeline.py --skip-fetch --skip-train
```

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Normalized data calculation**: Never calculate % changes on normalized data!
2. **Scale validation**: Always check prediction ranges make sense
3. **Backtest validation**: 0 trades is a red flag - investigate immediately

### Best Practices Going Forward
1. ✅ Use pre-calculated features when available
2. ✅ Store raw values before normalization
3. ✅ Validate prediction distributions
4. ✅ Sanity check: predictions should match real-world ranges
5. ✅ Test with small sample before full training

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

### When Training Completes (~1:30 PM)
1. Check predictions are in correct range
2. Run backtest
3. Verify trades are executed
4. Analyze results vs Phase 2.1

### If Successful (+2-4%)
- Document Phase 3.1 results
- Commit fixed code
- Plan Phase 4: Production prep

### If Still Issues
- Further investigation
- Consider alternative approaches
- Review model architecture
