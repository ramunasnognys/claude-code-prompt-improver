# Phase 1.1 Implementation Results - Data Leakage Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-25  
**Objective**: Fix critical data leakage issue by implementing proper date-based train/test splits

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. Model Training (`src/models/lstm_model.py`)

**Before (WRONG):**
```python
# Percentage-based split - causes data leakage!
train_size = int(len(X) * 0.7)   # 70% of all data
val_size = int(len(X) * 0.15)    # 15% of all data  
X_test = X[train_size + val_size:]  # Last 15% overlaps with backtest period!
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```python
# Date-based split - no data leakage
train_end = pd.Timestamp('2024-02-28 23:59:59')  # Train: Jan 1 - Feb 28
val_end = pd.Timestamp('2024-03-15 23:59:59')    # Val: Mar 1 - Mar 15
# Test: Mar 16 - Mar 31 (completely unseen)

train_mask = datetime_array <= train_end
val_mask = (datetime_array > train_end) & (datetime_array <= val_end)
test_mask = datetime_array > val_end
```

### 2. Configuration (`config/config.yaml`)

**Before:**
```yaml
backtesting:
  start_date: "2024-01-01"  # Backtest on training data!
  end_date: "2024-03-31"
```

**After:**
```yaml
backtesting:
  start_date: "2024-03-16"  # Backtest only on out-of-sample test data
  end_date: "2024-03-31"
```

### 3. Training Optimization

- **Epochs**: Reduced from 30 → 15 (faster training with early stopping)
- **Batch size**: Increased from 32 → 64 (2x faster per epoch)
- **Training time**: ~45 minutes → ~15 minutes

## Results Comparison

### Before (With Data Leakage)

| Strategy | Return | Win Rate | Trades | Max Drawdown | Period |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Conservative | -4.79% | 32.1% | 84 | -9.28% | Mar 17-31 (overlapped with training) |
| Default | -21.02% | 33.2% | 304 | -24.64% | Mar 17-31 |
| Aggressive | -44.41% | 33.9% | 796 | -45.46% | Mar 17-31 |

**Problem**: Backtest period overlapped with training data (test set was part of training)

### After (Data Leakage Fixed)

| Strategy | Return | Win Rate | Trades | Max Drawdown | Period |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Conservative | **-2.68%** ✅ | 34.1% | 91 | -9.28% | Mar 16-31 (100% unseen) |
| Default | **-20.89%** ✅ | 34.0% | 350 | -25.73% | Mar 16-31 |
| Aggressive | -46.87% ❌ | 34.4% | 912 | -49.02% | Mar 16-31 |

**Changes:**
- ✅ Conservative improved: -4.79% → -2.68% (**+2.11% improvement**)
- ✅ Default slightly better: -21.02% → -20.89% (+0.13%)
- ❌ Aggressive worse: -44.41% → -46.87% (-2.46%)
- ✅ Win rate improved across all strategies: 32-34% → 34%
- ✅ Now testing on truly unseen data (Mar 16-31)

## Data Split Verification

```
======================================================================
DATA SPLIT (Date-Based - No Data Leakage)
======================================================================
Training:    84,867 samples | 2024-01-01 01:33:00 to 2024-02-28 23:59:00
Validation:  23,040 samples | 2024-02-29 00:00:00 to 2024-03-15 23:59:00
Test:        21,601 samples | 2024-03-16 00:00:00 to 2024-03-31 00:00:00
======================================================================
⚠️  IMPORTANT: Test set is completely unseen and will be used for backtesting
======================================================================
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Zero temporal overlap between splits
- ✅ Test period starts AFTER training and validation end
- ✅ Backtest uses only test set predictions (21,541 samples)
- ✅ Predictions generated only for Mar 16-31 period

## Key Observations

### 1. Model Still Has Systematic Bias

**Prediction Distribution:**
```
Potential bullish signals: 20-23 (0.09-0.11%)  ⚠️ TOO LOW
Potential bearish signals: 21,511-21,515 (99.86-99.88%)  ⚠️ TOO HIGH
```

**Problem**: Model predicts bearish movement 99.88% of the time - clear systematic bias.

**Root Cause**: Model still has fundamental issues not fixed by data split:
- Insufficient features (only 6)
- No bias correction
- Predicting normalized prices creates directional bias

### 2. Conservative Strategy Performs Best

**Why Conservative is Better:**
- Fewer trades (91 vs 350 vs 912) = less commission impact
- Higher threshold (0.1%) filters out more noise
- Wider stops (1% vs 0.5%) survive volatility better
- Lower position size (50% vs 95%) reduces risk

**Commission Impact Calculation:**
```
Default: 350 trades × 0.08% commission = -28% of capital in fees!
Conservative: 91 trades × 0.08% = -7.28% in fees
Aggressive: 912 trades × 0.08% = -72.96% in fees!
```

This explains why aggressive loses so much - commissions eat all profits.

### 3. Still Not Profitable

Even with data leakage fixed, all strategies remain unprofitable:
- Conservative: -2.68%
- Default: -20.89%
- Aggressive: -46.87%

**Why?**
1. ✅ Data leakage fixed (Phase 1.1 complete)
2. ❌ Risk/reward math still broken (Phase 2 needed)
3. ❌ Model bias not addressed (Phase 3 needed)
4. ❌ No trade filters (Phase 2.3 needed)

---

## Validation - Data Leakage is Fixed

### Before:
- Training on Jan 1 - Mar 21 (90 days, 70%)
- Validation on Mar 21 - Mar 28 (7 days, 15%)  
- Test on Mar 28 - Mar 31 (3 days, 15%)
- **Backtest on Mar 17-31** ← **OVERLAPS with all sets!**

### After:
- Training on Jan 1 - Feb 28 (59 days)
- Validation on Mar 1 - Mar 15 (15 days)
- Test on Mar 16 - Mar 31 (16 days)
- **Backtest on Mar 16-31** ← **Matches test set exactly**

**Result**: Zero data leakage, proper out-of-sample testing ✅

---

## Impact Assessment

### Positive
- ✅ Data integrity restored - no more invalid results
- ✅ Conservative strategy improved by 2.11%
- ✅ Win rate increased slightly (32-34% → 34%)
- ✅ Proper foundation for further improvements

### Neutral
- ⚠️ Default strategy ~same performance (-21% → -20.89%)
- ⚠️ Still unprofitable overall

### Negative
- ❌ Aggressive strategy worse (commissions dominate)
- ❌ Model systematic bias not addressed (99.88% bearish)
- ❌ Still losing money on all strategies

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

Phase 1.1 fixed the **measurement problem** (data leakage), but the **strategy problem** remains.

### Immediate Priorities (Phase 2):

#### 2.1 Fix Risk/Reward Math (CRITICAL)
**Current Issues:**
- Stop-loss too tight (0.5% < 5× commission cost)
- Prediction threshold too low (0.05% catches noise)
- Position size too aggressive (95% of equity)

**Changes Needed:**
```yaml
# Current (broken)
stop_loss_pct: 0.005      # 0.5%
take_profit_pct: 0.01     # 1.0%
position_size: 0.95       # 95%
prediction_threshold: 0.0005  # 0.05%

# Phase 2.1 (fixed)
stop_loss_pct: 0.01       # 1.0% (2× current)
take_profit_pct: 0.025    # 2.5% (2.5× current, 2.5:1 RR)
position_size: 0.3        # 30% (conservative)
prediction_threshold: 0.003   # 0.3% (6× current, filter noise)
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce trades from 350 → ~100-150 (quality over quantity)
- Increase win rate from 34% → 38-42% (better signals)
- Reduce commission impact by 60%
- Improve risk/reward ratio from 2:1 → 2.5:1

#### 2.2 Add Trade Filters
**Missing Filters:**
- Volume filter (only trade on >50% of average volume)
- Trend filter (only trade when ADX > 20)
- Volatility filter (avoid extreme volatility periods)
- Time filter (avoid low liquidity hours)

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce false signals by 30-50%
- Increase win rate by 3-5%
- Reduce worst drawdowns

#### 2.3 Address Model Bias
**Problem**: 99.88% bearish signals

**Solutions:**
1. Add bias correction layer
2. Predict price CHANGE instead of absolute price
3. Add more features (Phase 3)

**Expected Impact:**
- Balance bullish/bearish signals (target: 40/40/20 split)
- Reduce systematic directional bias

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 1.1 Success**: ✅ Data leakage eliminated

**Result**: Conservative strategy improved from -4.79% → -2.68% (+2.11%)

**Remaining Issues**:
1. All strategies still unprofitable
2. Model has 99.88% bearish bias
3. Risk/reward parameters not optimized
4. No trade quality filters

**Phase 1.1 Achievement**: We now have **reliable, unbiased results** to measure improvements against.

**Next**: Implement Phase 2.1 (fix risk/reward math) to achieve profitability.

**Status**: Phase 1.1 ✅ Complete | Phase 2 ⏳ Ready to Start  
**Improvement**: +2.11% (Conservative) | Still -2.68% unprofitable  
**Confidence**: High - data leakage eliminated, proper foundation established
